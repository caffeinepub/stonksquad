  "architectural_notes": [
    "Product copy/terminology should avoid crypto jargon; prefer neutral language (e.g., “stocks/shares/credits”) throughout UI.",
    "Friend coins must have a fixed total supply with no inflation/minting after creation; price discovery should be driven purely by order flow (supply/demand).",
    "Replace/avoid the label “SQD balance” across the product; adopt a consistent alternative term (e.g., “Net Worth”).",
    "Gamification/leaderboard ranking metric should be based on creator market cap (market cap of coins a user launched), not portfolio performance or holdings.",
    "App will handle real USD value: implement compliant fiat on-ramp/off-ramp via Stripe (or equivalent) with KYC/verification as required.",
    "In-app trading/coin launches must use an on-chain USDC stablecoin balance (prefer Arbitrum if feasible); gas fees must be accounted for/deducted appropriately.",
    "Add Deposit and Withdraw pages/flows with transparent fee display, risk warnings, withdrawal limits, and anti-fraud checks.",
    "Fair-launch constraint: every new friend coin must launch with market cap exactly $0.",
    "Visual direction for images/illustrations: stoic yet fun (reduce “missions” vibe; emphasize alpha/dominance tone).",
