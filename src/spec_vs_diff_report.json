  "summary": "REQ-10 is implemented in both backend and frontend by removing the “_COIN” suffix and using the username directly as the per-user asset symbol. Backend per-user asset metadata strings were updated to avoid obvious crypto jargon (e.g., no \" Coin\" suffix / no emoji in the shown metadata). However, the anti-impersonation/name-claim requirements (REQ-9) are only partially implemented on the frontend and are not evidenced as persisted/enforced in the backend, and some user-facing copy still contains crypto-trope emojis (🚀) which conflicts with the “avoid crypto jargon/tropes” requirement (REQ-11).",
  "missing_requirements": [

      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "Backend persists additional profile metadata needed for name-claim/verification status (e.g., a claimed-name confirmation flag and any supporting fields).",

      "requirement": "Backend enforces at least one concrete anti-impersonation rule at write time (e.g., claimed display name uniqueness across all users or preventing claimed-name changes after initial creation), returning a clear error when violated.",
      "reason": "The diff does not show any write-time enforcement of an anti-impersonation rule (the createCallerUserProfile implementation is truncated and no such checks are evidenced elsewhere).",

      "requirement": "During first-time profile setup, the user must complete an explicit name-claim step (e.g., checkbox + short statement) before profile creation can be submitted, and backend persists/records that claim.",
      "reason": "The modal requires a local `nameConfirmed` boolean to submit, but the mutation payload only sends username/displayName/bio, so the backend cannot record the claim state from the shown code.",
